/**
 * Class for scanning a directory for files/directories which match certain criteria.
 * <p/>
 * These criteria consist of selectors and patterns which have been specified. With the selectors you can select which
 * files you want to have included. Files which are not selected are excluded. With patterns you can include or exclude
 * files based on their filename.
 * <p/>
 * The idea is simple. A given directory is recursively scanned for all files and directories. Each file/directory is
 * matched against a set of selectors, including special support for matching against filenames with include and and
 * exclude patterns. Only files/directories which match at least one pattern of the include pattern list or other file
 * selector, and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list or fail to match against a required selector will
 * be placed in the list of files/directories found.
 * <p/>
 * When no list of include patterns is supplied, "**" will be used, which means that everything will be matched. When no
 * list of exclude patterns is supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded. When no selectors
 * are supplied, none are applied.
 * <p/>
 * The filename pattern matching is done as follows: The name to be matched is split up in path segments. A path segment
 * is the name of a directory or file, which is bounded by <code>File.separator</code> ('/' under UNIX, '\' under
 * Windows). For example, "abc/def/ghi/xyz.java" is split up in the segments "abc", "def","ghi" and "xyz.java". The same
 * is done for the pattern against which should be matched.
 * <p/>
 * The segments of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other. When '**' is used for a path segment in
 * the pattern, it matches zero or more path segments of the name.
 * <p/>
 * There is a special case regarding the use of <code>File.separator</code>s at the beginning of the pattern and the
 * string to match:<br>
 * When a pattern starts with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match must also start with a
 * <code>File.separator</code>. When a pattern does not start with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match
 * may not start with a <code>File.separator</code>. When one of these rules is not obeyed, the string will not match.
 * <p/>
 * When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the following special characters can be used:<br>
 * '*' matches zero or more characters<br>
 * '?' matches one character.
 * <p/>
 * Examples:
 * <p/>
 * "**\*.class" matches all .class files/dirs in a directory tree.
 * <p/>
 * "test\a??.java" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two more characters and then ".java", in a
 * directory called test.
 * <p/>
 * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
 * <p/>
 * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs which start with "XYZ" and where there is a parent directory called test
 * (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").
 * <p/>
 * Case sensitivity may be turned off if necessary. By default, it is turned on.
 * <p/>
 * Example of usage:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * String[] includes = { &quot;**\\*.class&quot; };
 * String[] excludes = { &quot;modules\\*\\**&quot; };
 * ds.setIncludes( includes );
 * ds.setExcludes( excludes );
 * ds.setBasedir( new File( &quot;test&quot; ) );
 * ds.setCaseSensitive( true );
 * ds.scan();
 *
 * System.out.println( &quot;FILES:&quot; );
 * String[] files = ds.getIncludedFiles();
 * for ( int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++ )
 * {
 *     System.out.println( files[i] );
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * This will scan a directory called test for .class files, but excludes all files in all proper subdirectories of a
 * directory called "modules"
 * <p/>
 * This class must not be used from multiple Threads concurrently!
