${project.name}

   This project replaces {{{https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-utils/}plexus-utils}} for Maven.

   It is not a 100% API compatible replacement. We cleaned up methods, added generics, and removed unused code.

   This project adds new features, like {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/utils/logging/package-summary.html}styled message API}}.

Why?

   plexus-utils consisted mostly of code that originated in various Apache projects.
   Maven Shared Utils is based on those original Apache-source implementations.

Why not commons?

    We prefer code to use commons-* where appropriate. The plexus-utils versions became incompatible with the Commons versions over time. Migrating is not always a 1:1 operation. Migrating to Maven Shared Utils works in most cases as a 1:1 operation.
