${project.name}

   This project aims to be a functional replacement for
   {{{http://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-utils/}plexus-utils}} in Maven.
   
   It is not a 100% API compatible replacement though but a replacement <with improvements>:
   lots of methods got cleaned up, generics got added and we dropped a lot of unused code.

   Then there are additions, like
   {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/utils/logging/package-summary.html}styled message API}}.

Why?

   plexus-utils consisted mostly of code that was forked from various Apache projects. 
   maven-shared-utils is based on the original from the Apache sources.

Why not commons?

    We would prefer code to use commons-* where appropriate, but the plexus-utils became
    slightly incompatible (different) from the commons over the years, so migrating is not
    always a 1:1 operation. Migrating to maven-shared-utils is a 1:1 operation in most cases.
